## Thought process/Reason for approach
Since the method calls for the return of a List<String> I create a new list<String>, once thats done I create a for loop starting at 1 and loop all the way until I reach the *n*, always checking if *n* is a multiple of 3 and 5 first then check for 3 and 5 separately. If no multiples I convert the int to string to match the generics of the list.
