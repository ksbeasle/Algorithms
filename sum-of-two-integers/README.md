# Sum of Two Integers
[LeetCode]https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/

---
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

#### Example 1:

    Input: a = 1, b = 2
    Output: 3

#### Example 2:

    Input: a = -2, b = 3
    Output: 1

## Thought process/Reason for approach

Since we aren't allowed to use `+` or `-` I decided to go with incrementing. With just a count variable I check if either `int a` or `int b` are positive or negative and increment and decrement.
