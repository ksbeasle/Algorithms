# Reverse String
[LeetCode]https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

---
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

#### Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]

Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

#### Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]

Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Thought process/Reason for approach

Since the challenge requested a new array *NOT* be allocated I decided to use a String with the reversed characters and then replaced the array in the order the characters were in from the String.
